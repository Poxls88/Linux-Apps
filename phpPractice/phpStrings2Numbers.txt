I used .= so I could concatenate the text in my name to make a larger seed number. $longInput was set to an empty string. When I concatenate integer values to it, the first integer value I add appears on the far left. If it were initialized as"0" then the first number in my concatenated $longInput would always be 0.
        //bin2hex() might also suffice for ord and the opposite of the ord() is chr() wich makes strings from numbers.
